### DevLog 2-1 

#### Create an Astro Starlight DevLog site

Follow the [Astro Starlight](https://omundy.github.io/dig345-radical-software/tutorials/astro-starlight/) tutorial to create a JAMstack website with Astro.js. You will use this site to post DevLog entries to record your work throughout the semester. <IconTime>:40 min</IconTime>

1. [Fork an Astro Starlight site](https://omundy.github.io/dig345-radical-software/tutorials/astro-starlight/#create-an-astro-starlight-site) and update project structure.
