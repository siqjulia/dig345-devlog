### DevLog 3-3 

#### Create a full stack application using Node and Express

Create a full stack application following Chapter 9 of Critical Web Design and the [Bad Password API Node/Express](https://criticalwebdesign.github.io/wiki/chapter-09/9-4-bad-password-api/) tutorial. 

1. Read 📚 Chapter 9 in Critical Web Design. ✏️ Write a reflection about the Context for this chapter.
    <p> Reflection: I think the biggest takeaway from Chapter 9's context is that data that has your personal information attatched to it is the most valuable kind of data. A company can use it to build a profile on you and then retarget you in future marketing. It's almost like the information they collect on you creates a feedback loop where you keep interacting with the company. This is why collecting and selling data is such a valuable endeavor. The context made me reflect on how little control we have over our data except for small choices such as switching browsers to Brave or DuckDuckGo because companies have already built profiles on us. </p>

1. Fork an existing Github project ([criticalwebdesign/bad-password-api-starter](https://github.com/criticalwebdesign/bad-password-api-starter)) (CWD 9.3)
1. Connect to a remote API and use JSON data in a frontend (CWD 9.3)
1. Modify the project structure, install dependencies, and run the project. (CWD 9.4) 
1. Add static and dynamic API routes using Express.  (CWD 9.4) 
1. Create a free Vercel account  (CWD 9.4) 
1. Deploy your project on Vercel. (CWD 9.4) [Link](https://bad-password-api-starter-opal.vercel.app/)
1. Read 📚 [Hacktivist deletes white supremacist websites live onstage during hacker conference](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/hacktivist-deletes-white-supremacist-websites-live-on-stage-during-hacker-conference/), TechCrunch 2026 Post a reading response in your DevLog per information in the [Assignments](./#assignments).

<p> 
1. A hacker/activist (hacktivist) named Martha Root took down three white supremacist sites live during a conference and then used an AI bot to extract all of the poorly protected user data and then leaked it. 
1. "Root said that users’ images included precise geolocation metadata that 'practically hands out home addresses with a side of awkward selfies.'" 
1. I wasn't sure what the Chaos Communication Conference was, so I googled and found out that it is a similar conecpt to the Def Con conference that happens in Las Vegas every year. 
1. Something that I'd like to share is that I was thinking about the ethics around sharing passwords and emails. On the one hand, I am opposed to sharing personal information that should be protected. On the other hand, FAFO, white supremacists. 
1. I realized that I don't know many hacktivists, so I googled and found an article that lists the 10 most famous hacktivists: https://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/16368/1/ten-hacktivists-who-shook-the-web
</p>

1. Write a reflection explaining what you learned in your DevLog. Link to sources. ✏️
    <p> I learned how to publish something to Vercel and set up an API </p>
1. Publish it and turn it in by posting the direct link to this DevLog on Moodle.
