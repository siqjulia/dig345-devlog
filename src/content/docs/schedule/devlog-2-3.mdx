### DevLog 2-3 


#### Create an Astro blog site 

Follow [Astro's Build a Blog tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) to create a modular website using component-based design. Compare your finished blog site to the [tutorial example](https://github.com/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo/tree/complete) as needed. 


1. Create a new Astro site and publish it on Netlify<sup>[1](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/1-setup/)</sup>. Write the formatted command ✏️ here  using `npm create astro@latest` so you remember it. 
1. Create pages (`.astro` files) and blog posts (`.md` files) using frontmatter and file-based routing<sup>[2](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/2-pages/)</sup>. 
1. Use Astro [components](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/) (also `.astro` files!) to reuse common code across your website<sup>[3](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/3-components/)</sup>. 
1. Create reusable layout components using `<slot />` and `Astro.props` to inject child content<sup>[4](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/4-layouts/)</sup>. 
1. Create layout components for markdown files. Share anything that was difficult so far ✏️ 
    <p>
    I had difficulty understanding the /../../folder/file layout sometimes and it caused me a lot of headache. Also, the tutorial often had too many or two few /.. when I copied the code into my code which crashed the site. 
    </p>    
1. Display a dynamically generated list of posts on your Blog page<sup>[5](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/5-astro-api/)</sup>. 
1. Use Dynamic page routing with [`getStaticPaths()`](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/5-astro-api/2/) to specify and store static routes during build, and pass each page its own props.
1. Install Astro [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) integration. Use a `client:` directive for hydration on a UI framework component<sup>[6](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/6-islands/1/)</sup>. 🔥 Challenge: Already have experience with a UI library? Try to [integrate](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/) that one instead! For example, I used Svelte.
1. Modify your site design and content as if you were transitioning to Astro.js from an existing Wordpress site/blog. Duplicate the design, content, structure from the other site (not entirely, mind you, since this is just a mockup). Publish your blog site and put the url ✏️ here.
1. Copy and paste these instructions into `devlog-2-3.mdx` in your own [DevLog](https://github.com/omundy/dig345-devlog). Publish it. Then turn it in by posting a direct link to the page on Moodle.
